# VOP3 (Yamaha YSS236) instruction set, as measured

Reference for `tools/vop3_disasm.py` and `tools/vop3_interp.py`. Every claim names its evidence:
**FW** = read from the FS1R, PLG150-AN or AN1x firmware; **CHIP** = measured on rgwan's FS1R through the
debug monitor (FS1R.unlock `captures/2026-09-30-9`, `-10`; per-take tables in those READMEs). Anything
not marked is an inference and says so. The disassembler's output over every image we have is in
`docs/vop3_disasm/`: FS1R VOP3-1 (filter, 2 variants), FS1R VOP3-2 (base + 4 reverb + 16 variation +
2x12 insertion + test images 0 and 1), PLG150-AN (3 voice modes + base), AN1x (voice + boot, parameter-labelled).
Each line gives the raw fields, then the step as its measured operation (`y = s + k*(r[31] + r[30])`,
`dram[34] = y`, `d[0b] <- xfer(slot 36, else 37)`, ...); `python tools/vop3_disasm.py --listings` regenerates them.

## One chip

**VOP3-1 and VOP3-2 are the same chip; a result measured on either applies to both** (and to the PLG150-AN's
and AN1x's VOP3). No measurement on one contradicts one on the other. Where this doc gives a field two
descriptions (`path`, `r9[12]`, op table columns "VOP3-1 filter" vs "VOP3-2"), they describe the same
behaviour in two contexts: a step inside the FS1R filter's feedback loop, where a change closes, opens or
runs the loop away, and a step in VOP3-2's feed-forward test chain, where the same change reads out as plain
arithmetic. The one board difference is external: the FS1R's VOP3-1 has no DRAM attached, so its programs
carry no `mem` marks. The disassembler and interpreter decode every image with the one set of meanings.

## 1. The machine

* A program is **512 steps**, run in order once per sample. FW: every uploader (FS1R `FUN_0000BC8C`,
  PLG150-AN `FUN_0007f87c`, AN1x `FUN_00056028`) writes 512 rows.
* A step is **five 16-bit words**, chip registers 10, 9, 8, 7, 6 (`r10 r9 r8 r7 r6` here), plus a
  **constant** in register 0xB and a **tag byte** in register 0xC, all addressed by the step number in
  register 0. FW: all three uploaders. The AN1x's image packs the tag into the `r10` word
  (`r10 | tag<<4`), so it is part of the instruction, not a side table.
* **Register 0 is an address latch shared with everything.** The FS1R's 192 Hz tick writes cutoff
  constants through it with interrupts masked (`FUN_0000B6A4`); a step written from outside that
  critical section lands on whatever step the tick last named. CHIP: two takes lost to exactly this.
  The only safe write is the firmware's own patch path from the CPU shadow (`FUN_0000B600`).
* State the word addresses: a **register file `r[0..0x7f]`** (7-bit addresses in `r9`/`r6`), a
  **write area `w[0..0x3f]`** (6-bit addresses in `r6`/`r7`, class-2 results, read back through `rsrc`),
  **data memory `d[0..0x1ff]`** (9-bit address in `r8`, one entry per step: the constant table seen as
  memory, used for lookup tables), and on chips with DRAM a **delay memory** by slot (`r10[2:0]` marks
  the access, slot = step >> 2, base/length in registers 0x1A/0x1C per slot at upload). FW: AN uploaders,
  FS1R VOP3-2.
* **`r[]` is one 7-bit space laid out per voice, and `w[]` is not its upper half.** FW
  (`tools/vop3_verify.py`): FS1R filter channel c of group g reads exactly the register the same-position
  channel of group 0 reads plus 24g, or a group-shared one (444/444 reads), so group 2 reads `r[3b..4d]`
  where group 0 reads `r[0b..1d]`, straight through 0x40; the AN1x reads `r[1 + 5k + v]` for voice v with one
  step shape per k for k = 0..12 (`r[01..41]`). A "97% of reads at or above 0x40 name a `w[]` slot some
  step writes" count also holds, but it is a coincidence of two dense files and the stride test overrides
  it: `w[3e]` (the cutoff MAC's slot) is not `r[7e]`. Below 0x40 on the AN1x nothing writes `r[01..3f]`
  (no driver path either: the only sub-0x40 targets are class-1 loads to `r[00]` and the boot register
  block `0x24..0x2a`), so they are hardware inputs: the serial ports and internal generators fill them, the
  program reads them. On the FS1R the class-1 control word of channel c (`100`: k=8000 mutes) lands in
  `r[6c]` and nothing reads it: the hardware consumes it. `r[]` is the chip's per-voice I/O window plus the
  class-1 constants; `w[]` is the program's own scratch.
* The FS1R filter runs **four channels interleaved in a 124-step group**: channel c owns steps
  `base+3c..base+3c+2` (gain, mode, cutoff constant) and every step `base+0x0c+c+4n`; four groups from
  0x010 cover sixteen channels. CHIP: clearing any of a channel's 31 steps changes its output,
  clearing any other step of the group does not.
* **The register file is banked per filter channel** (inferred): clearing channel 4's cutoff load
  `08e` closes channel 4 although `012`, `097`, `10a`, `186` load the same `r[61]` with the same word
  in the same pass; the bank must follow the step's position. `tools/vop3_interp.py` models it as
  sixteen banks selected by the interleave.
* A filter type change does not re-upload: the firmware patches steps into the shadow and uploads
  those (`FUN_0000D050` -> `FUN_0000C6C0` -> `FUN_0000B600`), muting the channel around it via
  register 0x2B. CHIP: LPF24 patches two steps per channel (`r7 40d1 -> 50d1`, `r6 low bits`).

## 2. The word

```
r6  [15:14] class   [13:7] rB              [6] -      [5:0] wdst
r9  [15] mod        [14:13] -   [12] ?     [11:8] path   [7] mod   [6:0] rA / load destination
r7  [15:14] -       [13:12] route   [11] ?   [10] sel   [9] mod   [8:6] op   [5] -   [4] rd-en   [3:0] rsrc
r8  [15:7] daddr    [6:0] mmode
r10 [15:3] ?        [2:0] mem
```
`-` = inert on every step it was flipped on (CHIP). `?` = never probed.

| field | role | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `class` `r6[15:14]` | **1** constant load; **2** compute; **0** no output from this step; **3** loop runs away | CHIP: 1->0 and 2->0 silence the step's contribution, 2->3 runaway; on class 1 every other bit of r6 is inert |
| `rA` `r9[6:0]` | class 2: source register A, **added to `r[rB]`** when rB is set, ignored when rB is 0 (sessions 14/15); class 1: **destination register** of the constant | CHIP: VOP3-1 exact-match on every bit; VOP3-2 `x = r[rA] + r[rB]` (session 15) |
| `rB` `r6[13:7]` | class 2: **source register B**: `x = r[rB]` (+ `r[rA]`); 0 = the running value | CHIP: VOP3-1 exact-match; VOP3-2 sessions 13-15 |
| `path` `r9[11:8]` | exact-match per data path on VOP3-1's feedback loop (1..0xb across a group); inert on a feed-forward step | CHIP: VOP3-1 all 15 other values close the filter; VOP3-2 `0d3` 0..15 gain 1.000 (session 12) |
| `op` `r7[8:6]` | **3-bit operation**, section 3 | CHIP: swept 0..7 on two steps |
| `sel` `r7[10]` | **negates the running value** `s` (op 0 `-s + k*x`, op 4 `-s`; ops 1..3 unaffected) | CHIP: VOP3-2 session 12; VOP3-1's opened filter / constant output are the same sign flip inside the loop |
| `route` `r7[13:12]` | **scale of what the step writes out** (DRAM / bus): 3 = 1, 2 = 1/4, 1 = 1/8, 0 = 1/16; the value handed to the next step is not scaled; op 7 on route 3 gives 0 | CHIP: VOP3-2 sessions 12/14 |
| `rd-en` `r7[4]`, `rsrc` `r7[3:0]` | **with rB set: drops the gain `k`** (`y = x`); `w[rsrc]` never enters the arithmetic; with rB clear: inert | CHIP: VOP3-2 sessions 12/14; VOP3-1 `0f8` (session 9) |
| `wdst` `r6[5:0]` | **write slot** `w[wdst]` of the step's result; `rsrc` reads the same slots | CHIP: exact-match, 55/63 alternatives run away, bit-3 neighbours retune |
| `mod` `r9[7]`, `r9[15]`, `r7[9]` | modifiers: `r7[9]` ignored on the MAC probed; `r9[7]` and `r9[15]` share one signature (partial loss) | CHIP |
| `abs` `r7[11]` | **rectify: `y = abs(y)`** | CHIP: VOP3-2 session 15 (0.9997 x abs(output), residual -51 dB) |
| `r9[12]` | inert on a feed-forward step; one flip opened VOP3-1's filter | CHIP: VOP3-2 session 15 (gain 1.000, -62 dB); VOP3-1 session 8 |
| `daddr` `r8[15:7]` | 9-bit data-memory address. On the FS1R filter: lookup-table pointers into other steps' constants. On VOP3-2: `d[]` cell `n` = bits 6:0; bit 8 set addresses `d[]`: bit 7 = 1 the step writes `d[n]` (its route-scaled output; op 7 reads it), bit 7 = 0 **captures** into `d[n]` the DRAM transfer of slot s - 2 (else s - 1, else it holds) | FW: table indices; CHIP: VOP3-2 session 16 (`d[10a]` / 0e8 captures freeze, 0e0 with slot 36 empty takes slot 37, R == L bit-exact) |
| `mmode` `r8[6:0]` | inert on every step tried (VOP3-2 sessions 12 and 16, the DRAM read and write included) | CHIP |
| `mem` `r10[2:0]` | **delay-memory access, only on steps 3 mod 4, slot = step >> 2:** 1 = write the step's route-scaled output; 2, 3 = read the word written N passes ago (N = this slot's offset - the writing slot's); 4, 6 = one pass older; 0 = none. Offsets (reg 0 = slot, 0xd/0xe = 18-bit offset) index one 2^18-word ring whose pointer steps once per pass | CHIP: VOP3-2 session 16, lag = N to the sample for N = 0..16385, both-offsets shift inert, 2^14..2^16 + 17 no alias, off 0x3fff1 reads the other line 2^17 - 15 back; FW: test image 1 |
| constant (reg 0xB) | class 2: signed 1.15 **gain**; `rd-en` with rB set drops it (and `w[rsrc]` does not enter), with rB clear it stays (session 14). Class 1: the loaded value, 8.8 fixed point (`r = v/256`, session 14) | FW: the firmware patches k into class-2 steps on all three machines (FS1R gain `x120`, mode `x7c`, resonance A/B, type; AN1x mixer levels `x67`, pitch, PW, edge, sync; 69 of 69 AN1x handler targets and 112/112 FS1R targets are class 2 with `rd-en` clear), and a live constant on an `rd-en` step is rare: FS1R 0 of 240, AN1x 20 of 276 (7%, against 86% of the others), PLG150-AN 24% against 43%. So the read replaces the constant on the FS1R and nearly always on the AN; where both are present (the AN's 0x35c3 mixer group) the step has four sources and the MEG's `const * reg + reg` form is the reading. CHIP: session 9's 13 values on `0f8` changed nothing, and `0f8` is an `rd-en` step, so the two agree; the class-1 mute above 0x8000 stands. CHIP (VOP3-2, session 11): on the output step and the DRAM writer the constant is a signed 1.15 **gain** (linear, 0x4000 = half scale, sign follows k); with a zero input every op 0..7 and every k gives exact digital zero, so it is never an addend |
| tag (reg 0xC) | write-group id the firmware uses to patch steps by parameter: 3..7 = voice 0..4 on the AN1x, 1 = global; 0/1 on the FS1R filter | FW |

## 3. Operations (`op` = `r7[8:6]`)

| op | on the cutoff MAC (`098`: rA=62 rB=61 -> w[3e]) | at the output tap (session 10) | MEG counterpart | VOP3-2 `0d3`, measured gain on real audio (session 11 `held`; s = running value, k signed 1.15) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | runaway | passes rA | `p =s ... + p` accumulate | **y = s + k*s** (accumulate the product) |
| 1 | closed | floor (~0.02): does not pass rA; 100% carry a read | `p = m` / `p = r` forward move | **y = k*s** |
| 2 | **corner follows rA x rB** | passes rA | `p = c * r` multiply | **y = k*s** |
| 3 | closed | passes rA | `p = (c<<8) + (p>>15)` mul-acc | **y = k*s** |
| 4 | closed | passes rA | mul-acc with memory | **y = s**, k ignored |
| 5 | runaway | floor (~0.02): does not pass rA; lowest read rate | `p = c * r` fresh product (discards accumulator) | s shifted out: output is the sign only ({-2^-17, 0}), k ignored |
| 6 | closed | passes rA; 100% carry a read | accumulate-forward | 0 |
| 7 | closed | passes rA | shifted mul-acc | 0 (op 7 starts a chain; the running value is not its source) |

**Session 12 (VOP3-2, `captures/2026-10-01-0414-s12/README.md`) closes:** the output word is 18 bits
(LSB 2^-17); the pipeline lag is 2 samples; `sel` negates the running-value term (op 0 `-s + g*x`, op 4
`-s`, ops 1..3 unchanged); `route` scales the step's output 3 : 2 : 1 : 0 = 1 : 1/4 : 1/8 : 1/16; op 7
reads the input at any step (session 11's zero at `0d3` was on route 3); `path`, `r8[6:0]`, `r10` and the
DRAM offset registers are inert on a step of a program without a delay line.

**Session 13 (`captures/2026-10-01-0441-s13/README.md`) closes the operand files:** rA/rB address `r[]`,
never `w[]` (w[n] loaded with 0.5 x input reads the same through rB = n or 40|n as with nothing
loaded; `w[]` is reached only through `rd-en`/`rsrc`). A class-1 load lands in `r[]` and op 1 reads it
through rB (`r[30]` = 0x4000 -> a constant, zero-variance output). (Its "live `r[]`" reading is withdrawn by
session 15, below.)

**Session 14 (`captures/2026-10-01-0454-s14/README.md`), class-1 loads as known operands:** a class-1 load
is 8.8 fixed point (`r = v / 256`); the running value / DRAM word clips at +-8 (seen at two output gains);
the running value carries from step to step unscaled by route (op 0 `s + k*x` gives the same 4.000 at
`0d1`, `0d2` or `0d3`); op 1 reading `r[rB]` gives `x + k*x`; `rd-en` with rB set drops `k` and never
brings `w[rsrc]` in (`x` alone, 4.000 for w[0e] live or w[0f] unwritten), with rB clear `k` stays (session
12): VOP3-1's `0f8` (session 9) and VOP3-2 agree. op 0 ignores a loaded `r[rA]` alone.

**Session 15 (`captures/2026-10-01-0509-s15/README.md`) closes the operand and the remaining fields:**
with rA and rB both set the operand is the **sum** `x = r[rA] + r[rB]` (r[30] = 1, r[31] = 0.5/1/2, k = 0.5:
ops 0, 2 store 0.75/1.00/1.50, op 3 1.00, op 1 3.00); op 1 with rB is `x + k*x` (k = 0xc000/0/0x4000 store
0.5/1.0/1.5); op 0 ignores rA alone, loaded or not; `r7[11]` rectifies (`abs(y)`, 0.9997, residual -51 dB);
`r9[12]` is inert. Unloaded `r[]` registers hold constants left by earlier programs (96/127 zero, the rest
fixed values, none carries audio). A step's result reaches the next step in the same pass: there is no
write delay; when the chain head is missing the next step reads the value the previous step in program
order left (the other chain's end), which is what sessions 12/13 saw as a "live" register.

**On a step with no feedback the arithmetic is readable** (last column; VOP3-2's DRAM writer `0d3`, every
fit a pure gain of the same signal, residual equal to the reference's): the constant only multiplies, op 0
adds the product to the running value, ops 1..3 replace it with the product, op 4 passes it, op 5 shifts it
out. With the note off every op and k gives exact zero (take 2), so no op loads or adds k. Whether ops 0..3
multiply the running value or rA/rB is not split yet (on `0d3` they are the same signal).

**On VOP3-1 the op's arithmetic cannot be read from one probed step.**
Session 10 used the output stage's op-1 move as a DC voltmeter on a silenced channel; the tap is
AC-coupled, so `dc` read converter offset (-2e-5) on all 122 segments and the DC plan is dead. What the
level *did* show: the output passes `rA` alone, identically for ops {0,2,3,4,6,7}; ops 1 and 5 drop to a
fixed floor (they start/forward without passing the probed operand); `rB`, the read source, `path` (bar
the reserved slot 3), and every remaining `r7/r9/r10/r8` bit are all inert on a pass step. The op only
manifests through the recursive filter loop, which the FS1R never exposes. The MEG column is the close
(see section 7): the same operation *mix and ordering*, on a chip whose ISA MAME decodes to explicit
arithmetic. The FS1R program uses ops {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7} on class-2 steps, the AN1x {0..7}.

## 4. The FS1R filter's cutoff path, channel 0, read off the chip

```
08c  class 2  op 5  -> w[13]  rB=7f                  gain term: cleared, the loop runs away (+83 dB HF)
08d  class 2  op 4  route 1 -> w[05]                 mode: cleared, the resonance peak moves to 80-160 Hz
08e  class 1  r[61] = k                              staged cutoff constant (log frequency, tick-driven)
098  class 2  op 2  path 1  rA=62 rB=61 -> w[3e]     the MAC whose result the corner follows
09c  class 2  op 2  path 1  rA=62 rB=62 -> w[3d]  rd w[1]
0a8  class 2  op 2s        rA=62 rB=61 -> w[3f]      the resonance peak (cleared: -19 dB at 320-1280 Hz only)
0c4..0c7, 0d4..0d7                                   the two biquad sections: a state write (silence when
                                                     cleared), a feedback term (+19/+24 dB blow-up), a runaway
0e8  op 5  rA=1b rB=1b -> w[17] rd w[1]              state write (silence when cleared)
0f0  op 1  sel  rB=1c -> w[23] rd w[1]               output stage, bus A (-16 dB flat when cleared)
0f8  op 1  sel  rB=1d          rd w[1]               output stage, bus B (-16 dB flat when cleared)
100  class 1  r[1e] = k (k=8000)                     control word: a negative value mutes the output stages
```
Channel c adds c to every step address from 0x098 on and 3c to the first three, with its own registers.
The cutoff-byte-to-corner law is `docs/filter.md` (`15_filter`).

## 5. AN1x parameter labels

`docs/an1x_param_map.md` (from the scene-parameter table at `0xCFCEC`) names, for each of 56 knobs,
the steps whose constant it rewrites; `docs/vop3_disasm/an1x_voice.txt` carries them. Cutoff is a
class-1 load followed by a `6000 0004 3040 4000` step (class 1, `r9[14:13]` = 3, route 3, op 1, sel; 20 per
AN1x voice program, 7 on the PLG150-AN, after every sync/cutoff load: a log->linear conversion, as the EX5
MEG program does with an exp table); VCO pitch 4096/octave with a key term; mixer levels `level*0x67`.

## 6. Interpreter

`tools/vop3_interp.py` runs a program with the arithmetic measured on VOP3-2 (sections 3 and 8; the same
chip as VOP3-1). Class 1: `r[rA] = v/256` (8.8). Class 2: gain `g` = `k` (signed 1.15), 0 when `rd-en` and
rB are both set; running value `s` (`-s` with `sel`), one register passed step to step in program order;
operand `x` = `s` when rB = 0, `r[rB]` when only rB is set, `r[rA] + r[rB]` when both are; op 0 `s + g*x`,
op 1 `g*x` (`+ x` when rB is set), ops 2/3 `g*x`, op 4 `s`, op 5 sign of `s`, op 6 zero, op 7 `g x` the
chip's input (0 on route 3); `r7[11]` takes `|y|`; every result clips at +-8. `wdst` writes into `w[]`;
route 0 of an op-1 step goes onto the output bus. Its self-check reproduces session 11's `held` table and
`dc dram` silence, session 12's `sel` gains, session 14's eight stored values, session 15's sum, op-1 and
`r7[11]` results, and session 8's cutoff load (clearing it zeroes the MAC) and per-channel step ownership.
The delay memory is modelled from session 16: `r10` read/write on steps 3 mod 4, slot offsets into one
2^18-word ring stepping once per pass, route-scaled writes, `d[]` captures of slot s - 2; its self-check
reproduces test image 1's lags (N - 1 against image 0 for N = 0, 1, 2, 17), the moved read that plays the
left channel bit-exact, and the other line reached 2^17 - 15 back. Not modelled: the 2-sample output lag and
the 18-bit output word (fixed properties of the DAC path, not of a program).

## 7. Model check against the EX5 MEG (the close for the op arithmetic)

The FS1R VOP3 and the EX5 SWP30 MEG run the *same* AN algorithm; MAME decodes the MEG to explicit
arithmetic (`docs/ex5_meg_an.txt`, the AN program, 254 steps), so it is value-transparent where the
FS1R is not. `tools/vop3_meg_check.py` classifies every step of both into one vocabulary
(multiply / accumulate / load-constant / move / memory / lookup) and compares:

* **Operation mix matches.** MEG: 82% multiply-class, 4% load-constant, 13% memory. VOP3 AN1x voice:
  63% MAC-class, 7% load-constant, 19% memory. Both are MAC-dominated with a small constant-load
  population and a comparable memory fraction.
* **Step count is ~2x** (VOP3 512 vs MEG 254): the FS1R runs the engine at a higher internal rate.
* **The op-1/op-5 pairing reconciles.** Session 10 found ops 1 and 5 do not pass the probed operand at
  the output tap. In the VOP3 program op 1 and op 6 carry a read 100% of the time (operand-forward /
  accumulate, MEG's `p = m`), while op 5 is the largest op with the *lowest* read rate (a fresh product
  `p = c * r` that discards the running accumulator, MEG's most common op). So op 5's "does not pass the
  preloaded a" is exactly a new-product-start, and op 1's is a forward-move: both consistent with the MEG.

This validates the operation field as a genuine ALU-op selector with the MEG's operation semantics,
without needing the FS1R accumulator to be observable. Reproduce: `python tools/vop3_meg_check.py`.

**Dataflow check (`tools/vop3_verify.py`).** The MEG listing passes the trivial test (every `r`/`t` read has
a writer in the program, 260/260); the VOP3 images are tested for what their firmware and layout prove:
the constant is live on class-2 steps and dead on `rd-en` steps, `r[]` has the per-voice stride above
(FS1R 444/444, AN1x 13/13), which is what pins `w[]` as a separate file. An earlier reading of `w[n]` as
`r[0x40 | n]` passed a writer-coverage count at 97% and was wrong; the stride test is the one to trust.

## 8. Open

**The decode does not yet run a shipped program** (full list: `docs/vop3_blockers.md`). Every field above is measured on a feed-forward test chain, and `tools/vop3_gaps.py` runs the shipped programs through the interpreter and asserts three gaps that block a C++ rewrite from the decode:

* **VOP3-1 has no memory.** An impulse on any register filter channel 0 reads and does not load leaves in the same pass with no tail, so the filter as decoded has no pole. Routing class-2 results back into `r[n]` or `r[40|n]`, same pass or next, changes nothing. The state path is undecoded; `path` (exact-match on the feedback loop, inert feed-forward) and class 3 are the candidates.
* **VOP3-2 reaches no output.** Base image plus reverb 0, variation 0 and insertion 0/0, audio on the input port, every constant 0.5: zero non-zero output samples in 4096. Only test image 1 names its output steps (0e9/0eb); which steps of the shipped program feed the DAC is unknown.
* **Class 3 is not decoded** and carries the reverb: 16 of reverb 0's 29 live steps, 27 of the assembled VOP3-2 program, 32 of VOP3-1.

The per-type constants VOP3-2 runs with are not in the images either: `FUN_00039652` writes register 0xB from `DAT_0106842c`, which the effect parameter handlers fill.

Session 16 (`captures/2026-10-01-0535-s16`, test image 1) closed the delay memory: the `mem` and `daddr`
rows of section 2 and the interpreter's DRAM model are its measurements. Recorded but not modelled, because
no shipped program uses them: a capture step at 0dc..0de or 0e5 (R == L at lag 0 / +1 on test image 1) and
0e0 turned into a `d[18b]` step write (0e9 at 0.42 x L).

**Sessions 17-19 (remote rig, 2026-10-01; folders on the rig under `~/FS1R.unlock/captures/2026-10-01-17*`):**

* **op 0 with rA and rB both set, below route 3: rA is a destination, not an operand.** x = r[rB], y = s + k x,
  and r[rA] = y (scaled x16 by route, as the d[]/DRAM writes are: route 0 x1, route 1 x2). With rA = rB this
  is a recursive integrator: r[32] settles to s / (1 - k) at route 0 (s = 0.375 / 0.5, k = 0..0.25: 0.375 /
  0.3999 / 0.4285 / 0.5 and 0.5 / 0.5333 / 0.5714 / 0.6666, all to 1e-4) and 2s / (1 - 2k) at route 1
  (s18: s = 0.25, k = 0.25 / 0.125: 1.0 / 0.667). The
  register keeps its value across passes: this is the chip's state, the comb's damping pole (base 0a5) and the
  missing VOP3-1 filter memory. Route 3 still sums (session 15). Interpreter: in, with its self-check.
* **Class 3 is class 2 at unity gain with rA as destination.** k is ignored; op 0 gives s + r[rB], op 1 2 r[rB]
  (x + x), ops 2/3 r[rB], op 4 s, op 5 r[rB] (not sgn); r[rA] and the running value both take y (s19,
  s = 0.5, r[33] = 0.25, all six exact). Clearing the reverb window's 16 class-3 steps silences the reverb
  (s17 `c3_off`, R exact zero). Interpreter: in.
* **rd-en with rB set: the gain is a 16-entry file G[rsrc], not k and not zero.** Op 2, x = 1.0, k 0.5:
  G = 0.99988, 0.10144, -0.07422, 0, -0.33203, 0, 0.99988, 0, -0.50757, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0 (rsrc 0..f),
  linear in x (x = 0.5 halves it), the same on ops 0/2/3; op 1 adds x (1.10144). A step writing w[02] in the
  same pass does not change G[2], so G is not this pass's w[]. Its writer is open (blocker 4 narrowed):
  the values are what the effect programs left. Interpreter: the measured table, as a constant.
* **Class 1 with rB set adds:** r[rA] = k/256 + r[rB], r[rB] unchanged (2.0 + 0.5 = 2.5, both r7 forms).
* **Comb 1 (Hall1, time 0.8 s) on the unit:** period 4974 samples = read slot 22 - write slot 2a (+1000 on
  either moves it by 1000, slot 28 inert), echo ratio 0.412 = the loop 2 (x3 + x4 z^-1) / (1 - 2 p z^-1) of
  0a3/0a4/0a5's words at its peak (`tools/vop3_comb_check.py`, five segments). Zeroing 0a9's word kills the
  comb (0a9 is the input gain).
* **Off-phase DRAM marks are live:** the write moved to phase 2 still writes; to phases 1 / 0 it changes the
  line (gain 1.1, lag 0); a read on phase 1 also reads. r10 = 5/6/7 on the write and 5/7 on the read are
  not the shipped meanings (uncorrelated / unchanged).
* **Output path (s17 `walk`, Hall1, noise held):** the dry note (L, part panned hard left) drops 25-35 dB
  only when 002, 0e0, 0e7 or 0ea is cleared; the reverb (R) goes to exact zero only when 0d5 or 0d9 is cleared.
  Clearing 12d left R dead for the rest of the take (state latched at zero), so steps after 12d were not
  measured on R, and the note clipped L near 0 dBFS. Needs a re-walk at a lower level with a state reset.
* **EQ frequency:** the dumped coefficients evaluated at 48 kHz fit the measured responses better than at
  44.1 kHz on all three (1.37 / 1.45 / 1.38 dB rms against 1.42 / 1.55 / 1.60), the measured peaks sitting
  at 539 / 1131 / 2150 Hz for words designed at 500 / 1000 / 2000 Hz at 44.1 kHz. Leaning 48 kHz; the
  fit is not decisive.

**Sessions 20-23 (remote rig): VOP3-2's buses, and a reset that needs no power-cycle.**

* **Output:** the left / right DAC words are r[09] / r[0a] after the last step (a class-1 load of 0.25 into
  either at the free step 10f reads 0.5 x 1/16 on that channel only; DAC = r / 8). The base program writes them
  last at 0e7 / 0df (op 0, route 2, rA the destination).
* **Inputs (s22, all 127 registers read into L per bus configuration):** the reverb send pair arrives in
  r[03] / r[04] (and r[57..5c]), the variation send pair in r[05] / r[06] (and r[67..6c]), the insertion pair
  in r[07] / r[08] (and r[43..4e]); each at the same level (-49.5 dB on a -42 dB send). The dry part reaches
  the output already mixed: with the effects off, r[09] / r[0a] and the output-EQ chain r[23..2a] carry it at
  the DAC level, 1-3 samples ahead. So the chip's audio inputs are register writes by the hardware before the
  pass, which is where the "read, never written" registers of the program come from.
* **Reset:** FUN_0003AAC8 (the boot's VOP3-2 sequence: init, every effect handler, programs, unmute) plus
  all-notes-off clears latched state; FUN_0003A064 + FUN_0003A110 alone leave the chip muted.
  FS1R.unlock `tools/vop2_reset.py`.
* **End-to-end (s23):** the effect input r[03] (or r[05]) and the output r[0a] recorded together for reverb
  0/1/9/13/16 and variation 1/9, with the constants, offsets and selectors dumped. The interpreter fed that
  input does not reproduce the output yet: the reverb program saturates (+-8) inside the comb section and
  r[0a] stays 0. That run is the acceptance test the C++ rewrite needs; it is not passed.

**Session 24 (remote rig, rounds 1-4, 80 DC probes; `docs/vop3_probes.json`, `tools/vop3_probe.py check`).** One
rule set reproduces 79 of them and session 11's op table; it replaces the session 18/19 readings above (they were
the special cases rA = rB and route 0 of it):

* x = r[rB]; **rB = 0 names r[0], the chip input**, not the running value (rB 0 on a silent input gives 0 on
  ops 1/2/3; op 0 then passes s).
* y = op(s, k, x), then **y is scaled by the route, x1 / x2 / x4 / x16 (route 0..3)**, and s = y.
* **rA != 0 writes r[rA] = y** on every class-2/3 step, any route (route 3 included: the session 15 "sum"
  was this write plus the next step's read).
* Class 3 is class 2 with k = 1. Class 1 loads r[rA] = k/256 plus r[rB] (rB set) or plus s (rB 0), scaled by
  the route, and s takes the value.
* Open: one probe (`G5_op6_r30_r`, class 1 r7 = 0x1180, the shipped op-6 load form) stores -8 where the rule
  gives +8; and nothing tried writes the rd-en gain file G[] (op-6 loads with wdst 5/7, a plain load and a
  class-2 step with wdst 5: G[5] stays 0).

**End-to-end (`tools/vop3_e2e.py`, session 23's recorded input):** still 0 on r[0a] for var1, rev1, rev9; the
insertion-1 window saturates within one pass (its steps lean on G[12] / G[13] and the op-6 loads, both open).

**Sessions 24-27 (remote rig): number formats, latency, z^-1 registers, the real DAC taps.**
Measured on the unit; every rule is asserted by `tools/vop3_interp.py` (349 probes in `docs/vop3_probes.json`)
or `tools/vop3_ship.py` (shipped program, `docs/vop3_ship/`, 41 of 41).

* Registers hold [-128, 128) (word / 256); the running value s is [-256, 256). r7[15:14] picks the overflow
  rule: 0 wraps, 1 saturates, 2 clamps negatives to 0, 3 takes |y|.
* A register written at step n is readable from step n + 3; steps n + 1, n + 2 see the old value.
* Class 1: r[rA] = k/256 + s (rB does not replace s), times the route.
* Op 5 with rB set (class 2): max(r[rB], 0), k only gates; the comb input steps use it.
* rd-en gain file G[rsrc]: a fixed table (same on a blank image and under the insertion program; no step writes it).
* rA with bit 7 set (word 1 bit 7) is a z^-1 write: the register gets the previous step's x operand (r[rB] of
  the step before), not this step's result; after a step with rB = 0 it gets its own x. The base program's
  biquads (066-074, 0b6-0c4) keep their delay state this way.
* d[] holds at least +-32 (it is not clipped to the DRAM word's +-8).
* The DAC plays d[0x10] (L) and d[0x11] (R), written by base steps 0cf / 0d0 (route 3, x16); unit readout =
  d / 4 in the s25 units (DAC full scale = d 32). Session 22's "r[09] / r[0a] after the last step" was only
  what the base program reads into them. Steps 06a / 0ba are where the output biquads read r09 / r0a.
* Input registers change mid-pass: r0e tapped at 0x010 and at 0x110+ differ by one sample (boundary between
  0x108 and 0x110), r0d by two; the external (VOP3-1 to VOP3-2) bus writes land partway through the pass.
* Still open: probes that break the output biquad loop (06a-06e, 0b9-0bb) settle at +-8 on the unit with a
  sign the model does not reproduce (unstable loops, history-dependent); the end-to-end replay needs a fresh
  paired take using the tap method above and the mid-pass input timing.

**Session 28 (remote rig): step responses on the shipped programs, sample-exact.**
`tools/vop3_step.py`, `tools/vop3_seq.py`; kept-patch probes (s25 runner `keep`), data in FS1R.unlock s28 folders.

* Base program inputs (steps 000-007) re-pointed at a loaded register and stepped 0 -> 1/16: the dry path of
  every shipped program (none, Hall1, variation 1, Hall 9) matches the model to the bit: DAC word 18-bit,
  value floor(d / 4 x 2^14) / 2^14 (readout units), R leaves the chip in the pass the input changes, L one pass
  later (`Interp.dac()`).
* 24 register taps (0cf re-pointed) on Hall1 with the step held: all match the model.
* The reverb tail does NOT appear in the model: on the unit, L (tapped at r77/r78/r1d/r29) starts moving
  1346 / 1473 samples after the step (r37/r3c: 5112 / 5619), with exact first samples 0.000977, 0.002319,
  0.002869, 0.003052. The model's delay memory stays empty: its comb feed is op 7 / op 4 steps with rB = 0
  (0x2a-0x2e, 0xa3-0xb3, 0xd2-0xd3) whose source is not modelled. Probes so far:
  - op 7 / op 4 source is not d[] when daddr bit 8 is clear, not w[r6 slot], not the register x (rounds 13-15,
    all read 0 on test image 0, where no DRAM transfer runs).
  - Hypotheses tried against the 1346-sample onset and rejected: op 7 = k x previous step's x (right sample
    values, but no delay: tail at sample 0); op 7 / op 4 = k x the DRAM transfer of slot s - 2 / s - 1 (no
    tail at all, the memory is never written).
  - Next: a probe on the shipped program that writes a known value into one comb's DRAM write step and reads
    the op 7 chain's result through 0cf, to find which transfer op 7 multiplies.

**Session 29 (remote rig): the shipped Hall1 step by step; op 7's operand; class-1 d[] writes.**
Shipped Hall1 with every DRAM write cut (r10 = 0) and the inputs held at 1/16, each of its 380 live steps tapped
in turn to d[10] (daddr 190, the left DAC): **378 / 380 match the model** (`docs/vop3_ship/29c.*`). Rules added:

* **Op 7's operand is d[r6[5:0]]** (the step's `f6c` field), not daddr: probe D_o7_10 (f6c 0x10) reads the
  left's d[10]; daddr 18d with f6c 0 reads 0 (s24 round 14). Test image 0's own op-7 steps (0d0 f6c 01, 0d4 f6c
  05) read the audio input, so the input arrives in d[1] / d[5] (`INPUT_D`, test-image layout only).
* **Class 1 with r9[12:8] set writes d[n]** for daddr 0x180|n (the 8 Hall1 taps on its `1c7c` / `1d01` / `1c7e`
  loads); plain, op-6 and op-1 loads write nothing there.
* Memory probes need test image 1 (`{"image": 1}` in the s24 runner) or a shipped program; on test image 0 no
  DRAM transfer is observable (every round-16/17 memory probe read 0 on both images, so the transfer path of
  hand-built steps is still not understood; image 1 as shipped (J_ship) does round-trip a value).

Still open, blocking the reverb tail (the model's delay memory stays empty on Hall1, the unit's L tail starts
1346 samples after the step: read slot 0 (offset 29998) minus write slot 0xd (28652), moved 1:1 by slot 0xd's
and slot 0's offsets (346 / 1614 after +-1000), so the tail is the delay line written at slot 0xd (step 0x37,
op 4 rB 0, mem 1) and read at slot 0 (step 0x03)):
* what the comb write steps (op 4 / op 5 / op 7 with rB = 0 and mem 1) carry: tapping them on the unit gives 0
  with memory writes cut, while tapping 0x29 / 0x34 (op 5 rB 34 / 31, k 0) with memory live gives a rising
  non-zero value (0.0065, 0.0156, 0.0191, 0.0208 readout) that the model's op-5 gate (k 0 -> 0) does not produce.

**Session 30 (remote rig): the reverb tail starts in the model, to the sample.**
Hall1 step response, input 0 -> 1/16 (s28 takes; s29a offset-moved takes; s30a: sixteen d[] cells tapped through
an op-7 step at 0cf). Rules added to `tools/vop3_interp.py`, all against unit data:

* **Op 5 with rB: max(r[rB], 0) + k x d[f6c]** (the comb write: feedback plus input gain); k does not gate
  (K_o5_k0 on image 1 writes 0.25 with k 0). **Op 4: s + k x d[f6c]** (the FIR taps).
* **Captures land three steps late** (`CAPLAT = 3`): with it the L tail of every Hall1 take starts on the
  unit's sample (1346 as shipped, 346 with slot 0xd + 1000; taps r77 / r1d / 02b / 02c / 02e / 036 / 037 / 03f
  match their first ~100 tail samples to the LSB).
* **DRAM reads and writes also run on phase 1** (step & 3 == 1; the shipped comb writes 0a9..0b5, 0d1).
* **Op 7 writes d[daddr]** like the other ops, except onto its own source cell.
* **d[] has 64 cells: the cell is daddr & 0x3f** (Hall1's comb outputs at daddr 1e2..1e7 land in d[22..27];
  their onsets 5587 / 4880 / 4200 / 3763 match the model within one sample).

Measured and not yet matched (`docs/vop3_ship/30a.probes.json`, takes in FS1R.unlock s30 folders):
* tail amplitude: d[3e] (op-4 FIR at 04c-04f) is 0.46 x the model from its first sample; the rest of the tail
  follows it, so the late tail (beyond ~1490 samples on L, ~1487 on R) drifts by 1-30 LSB.
* d[26], d[27], d[39], d[3c] stay 0 in the model but carry the tail on the unit (onsets 3066, 5080, 3066, 1487);
  d[17] moves in the model (614) and stays 0 on the unit.
* o0p1000 (slot 0 + 1000): unit 1614, model 1997.

**Session 31: d[] write timing, DRAM regions, the upper d[] bank.** Checked against the s30a d[]-cell taps and
s31a step taps (steps 040, 041, 04c..04f with memory live; `docs/vop3_ship/31a.probes.json`).

* **A step's d[] write lands 3 steps later in the same pass** (`DLAT = 3`), not at pass end. This was the
  0.46 "gain" on d[3e]: with it d[3e] matches the unit to 1 LSB over its first 400 samples (it was 0.46 x).
  Steps 040..04f themselves match to 1 LSB.
* **mmode bits 3:2 select a DRAM region** (`REGION`, size assumed 2^16; Hall1 0x1d3 / 0x177 carry 0x44 / 0x48).
  Without it 0x1d3 overwrote 0xd1's comb line. d[3c] now starts on the unit's sample (1487).
* **Class-0 steps with mem 1 write the running value** (Hall1 0x153, the 1452-sample line read at 0xa3).
* **Steps >= 0x100 use the upper 64 d[] cells** (`DHI`): d[17] (written by 0x11c) stays 0 on the unit; now in
  the model too.
* Regression: 384 / 384 s24 probes, s28a dry takes bit-exact.

Open:
* **daddr bit 6 (0x1e2..0x1e7, the comb outputs):** onsets match (d22..d25 to the sample), level is ~4-5.6 x the
  model and not a plain gain; a lag -1 fit gives y = 3.99 x(read at 0xa3, one step earlier), i.e. close to a x4 copy
  of the DRAM read. Four simple variants (4 x previous operand, 4 x running value, now / pass end) do not fit.
* d[26], d[27], d[39] still silent in the model (unit onsets 3066, 5080, 3066).

**Session 32: daddr bit 6 (the Hall1 comb-output writes 0x1e2..0x1e7).** Probes edit step 0a4 / 0a3 of shipped
Hall1 and tap d[22] (`docs/vop3_ship/32a.probes.json`, `32b.probes.json`). Capture check: the takes carry 18
effective bits, left-justified (low 14 bits zero in all 587k non-zero samples of the s31 take, no dither).

* With bit 6 set and k != 0, the step writes d[n] = the previous step's operand (d[f6c] of 0a3), not its own
  result: d[22] = 3.987 x the op-7 read, lag 1, residue 1 LSB (`base`). The op and the value of k do not
  matter (k 0x0800 / 0x4000 / 0xc000 and op 0 all give the same take). k = 0 gives the plain write
  (`k0`: d[22] = 0a4's result, 1 LSB), as does clearing bit 6 (`b6off`, 1 LSB).
* Now in the model: d[22] matches 1 LSB for its first 9 samples, then drifts.

Measured, not explained:
* Step 0a3 with k = 0: the unit's d[22] is 0, the model's is not. So the written value does depend on
  0a3's k after all. The 3.99 x operand fit is a coincidence of this k, or the value is 0a3's product times
  a fixed gain (0.17834 x 22.36).
* 0a3 k = 0x4000: d[22] alternates +8 / -8 every sample on the unit (a sign-flipping loop through d[38]).
* 0a4 k = 0x7fff: d[22] = -8 constant.
* d[23..27], d[38..3f] drift after 4..40 samples; d[26], d[27], d[39] stay silent in the model.

**Session 33: bit-6 rule settled, Hall1 step taps with memory live.** (`docs/vop3_ship/33a.probes.json`,
`33c.probes.json`; s32a / s33b probes ran with `keep`, so each probe carries the earlier patches: the s32
"0a3 k = 0 silences d[22]" result was 0a4 k = 0 plus 0a3 k = 0, not a dependence on 0a3's k.)

* **daddr bit 6 writes d[n] = the previous step's operand d[f6c]**, one pass later, whatever this step's op,
  k or the previous step's k: 0a3 k = 0x0400 / 0x0b6a / 0x16d4 / 0x2000 / 0xe92c all give the identical d[22]
  take (gain 3.987 on the model's d[38] read, residue 1 LSB). Without bit 6 it is the plain result write.
* **Class-0 steps with mem 1 write nothing** (s31's "running value" rule withdrawn; it zeroed 0xd1's line).
  d[26] and d[39] now start on the unit's sample (3066).
* 28 Hall1 step taps with memory live (01d..08f): 27 match to 1 LSB over 2400 samples; 08f drifts at 2389.
* d[] cells: d16, d17, d22 exact over 6000 samples; the others start on time and match for 1060 samples,
  then miss a negative step (d3c at 2549 = 1487 + 1062: the 0x57 -> 0x33 line, written with 0 in the model).
* Step-response takes (s28a, 8000 samples): Hall1 exact to sample 2088, Hall9 to 1905; tail rms error 1.3x
  (Hall1) and 1.1x (Hall9) the unit's tail rms.

Open: what 0x57 / 0x157 / 0x19f (op 0, k 0, mem 1, rB 78 / 7a) write into DRAM. Writing r[rB] makes the tail
worse (`B13X`, rejected). Swapping the capture source order (`CAPORDER`) breaks 0..613: rejected.


**Session 34: all 128 slot offsets; r9[13] is the DRAM write-data select.** (`tools/vop3_board.py` scores every
dynamic take on disk through the C++ core, `src/fs1r/chips/vop3_core.h`, which `tools/vop3_core_check.py` holds
bit-identical to `tools/vop3_interp.py`.)

* **The chip has 128 delay slots.** FUN_000397F4's slot lists run to 127 (0x35E23C, 0x35E398) and the area table
  at 0x3720A4 has 128 bytes; every dump before s34 read 64. The rig dump (FS1R.unlock
  `captures/2026-10-02-035714-s25`, Hall1 and Hall9) gives the upper 64 with their area bases (0x10000 / 0x20000 /
  0x30000) and the lower 64 identical to s28. s31's mmode `REGION` guess was standing in for those bases; the model
  now indexes `offs[slot & 0x7f]` and the guess applies only to a 64-slot dump.
* **r9[13] on a step makes its output the data of the next DRAM write; a writer carrying r9[13] writes its own.**
  This replaces s30's "op 5 with rB loads the write latch" (every shipped op-5 comb step carries r9[13]) and s33's
  "class-0 mem-1 steps write nothing": Hall1's 0x153 / 0x19b / 0x1d3 / 0x1eb are class 0 and write the value the
  preceding r9[13] step latched (0x146, 0x18e, 0x1cc, 0x1ea). Unmarked writers (0x57, 0x9b) write their own result
  after a marked step's write has consumed the latch. Census over every VOP3-2 window: r9[13] on 178 steps, 109 of
  them on a mem-1 step.
* Scoreboard, 114 step-up segments (s28 and s30-s33 takes): Hall1 step response exact (1 LSB) to sample 5131 L /
  5002 R (was 2088 / 2228), Hall9 5657 / 5656 (was 1905 / 2039); 102 segments clean past 5000. Python self-check
  384 / 384.

Open: every Hall1 take still misses at 5002 on R and the segments of the s33 08c-08f / 054-05b round (FS1R.unlock
`2026-10-02-024751-s25`) at 3065 / 3066; ua4k0800 (0a4 k = 0x0800 after 0a4 = 0x7fff drove the loop to the clip)
does not recover in the model the way the unit does, which points at the clip / overflow rule inside the comb loop.

**Session 35: op 5 passes negatives; the real input registers; first noise replay.** (FS1R.unlock s25/s24 folders
`2026-10-02-050244` .. `071415`; probe sets `docs/vop3_ship/35a`-`35k`.)

* **Op 5 with rB is r[rB] + k d[f6c], no clamp.** s24's `max(r[rB], 0)` came from its operand load running in
  mode 2 (r7 = 0x8000 clamps negatives): with the same load in mode 1 the step stores -1/256 .. -64/256 exactly
  (`M5_*`, 7 probes, r9[13] set or clear; `N5_*` re-measure the mode-2 zeros). Both are asserted in
  `docs/vop3_probes.json` (398 / 398). Effect on the shipped Hall1 / Hall9 step responses: exact (1 LSB) to
  7312 / 7452 samples (was 5131 / 5657), and to the full 6000-sample window on 154 of 176 step-up segments.
* **The comb's 5002 miss was this clamp, not the delay line.** Moving slot 0x15's offset by +-500 (s35a) moved the
  unit's and the model's first difference from the reference by the same amount, so 0x57's line and its data
  were right; the remaining combs went negative at 4129 / 4826 / 5263 and the clamp cut them.
* **VOP3-2's effect inputs are r[0d] / r[0e] (reverb send) and r[0f] / r[10] (variation send)** (s35h: the left
  DAC re-pointed at each of r[0b..12] with noise on each bus). No step writes them; base steps 002-005 read them
  in place. The two reverb registers carry the same mono send, r[0e] one pass ahead of r[0d]. Session 22's
  r[03..08] were registers the program computes from these.
* **First noise replay (`tools/vop3_replay.py`, take s35j, 0.5 s of noise after a 2000-sample warm-up):** Hall1
  fed the recorded r[0d] (r[0e] one pass later) correlates 0.795 with the unit's right output, 3.8 dB low;
  Hall9 0.505, 2.9 dB low. Variation 1 is not a valid replay yet (its two inputs are uncorrelated stereo and the
  take recorded one). The step responses agree to 7300 samples, so the replay's gap is the input level / timing
  within the pass and the long-tail rules below, not the early reverb.
* Withdrawn: s30's "op 5 with rB loads the DRAM write latch" (s34, r9[13]) and s24's op-5 clamp (above).

Open:
* **Op 7 at route 3:** the shipped 09b (rA 15, mem 1, f6c 3a) taps exact zero on the unit, as do 09b with rA or
  mem cleared and with both cleared; a d[] tap at 0cf (op 7, route 3, f6c 3c) passes, and the same tap with rA
  set reads -1 LSB, with mem 1 starts 4670 samples late (s35k). No single field explains all of them yet.
* The comb-loop overflow: 0a4 k = 0x7fff drives the loop to the clip on the unit (sign-flipping at full scale)
  and the model pins at +8; recovery after k is restored differs.

**Session 36 (in progress): insertion input, mono reverb pair.** (FS1R.unlock `2026-10-02-073531-s25`, `-075023-s25`.)

* The insertion send lands in r[11] / r[12] (r[12] the same signal as r[0x0f+..] taps, corr 1.000 with the right
  output's input); r[01] / r[02] read large offsets (+6.5 / +5.2 readout) under the insertion load. Base steps
  000-007 scale r[0b..12] in place (op 3, k 0x5a82 on the live pairs), so "read, never written" missed them: they
  are rA = rB steps.
* With the part panned hard left, the reverb pair is r[0e] = 0.1532 x r[0d] two passes later (resid 1.6%);
  the variation pair is r[10] = 0.5 x r[0f] same pass (resid 0.1%). These are the send-level pan law, not chip
  rules.
* rev1L replay (exact mono input, both registers driven): corr 0.75, level -5.3 dB. Program step 0x14f writes
  r[0d] (and 0x155 r[0e]) every pass, so when in the pass the hardware's write lands decides what step 002 reads;
  that timing is the next measurement.
* d[] cells read but written by no step (01, 02, 03, 05, 06, 07, 17, 28 and the upper 44/48/4c): only d[03] and
  d[28] carry signal under variation 1, d[02] and d[05] under insertion 1, r[04]-high (d[44]) under reverb. These
  are the hardware's per-bus d[] inputs; not yet in the model.

**Session 36d: click replay of shipped Hall1 / Hall9 against the unit.** (FS1R.unlock `2026-10-02-082621-s25`; the
s25 runner gained a per-probe `retrig`, a fresh note after the patch, so each tap segment holds the same click,
repeatable to the LSB through the early reverb.)

* **The input tap reads r[0d] after steps 002/003 scale it in place** (op 3, rA = rB, k 0x5a82 = 0.7071), so the
  replay must inject tap / 0.7071. That was the whole 3 dB of the s35 noise replays.
* **r[0e] carries the same mono send two passes after r[0d].** Shifts tried (0..2 / -1..3): only (0, 2) holds
  past the first echoes (first >30 LSB at 4324 vs 1880).
* Result (`python tools/vop3_replay.py`, asserted): Hall1 exact to sample 1888 then corr 0.978 over 0.4 s, level
  -0.2 dB; Hall9 exact to 2236, corr 0.971, -0.6 dB. The step responses agree further (7312 / 7452) because a DC
  step never exercises the modulated taps: a 256-sample local fit puts the click tail 0.75-1.1 samples late in
  the model, the signature of a modulated delay read (VOP3-2's LFO registers 0x24-0x27, which the model has none
  of; the depth words read 0x7fff for blocks 1-3 on the unit).
* d[44] (seen live under reverb) is only read by the class-3 parameter smoothers at 0f0-106, which the model
  treats as pass-throughs: not an audio input.

Next: the LFO. Registers 0x24 (speed, 0x36EF54[v]), 0x25 (waveform bits 5-7), 0x26 (depth), 0x27 (direction) per
LFO channel, four per effect block; which step field reads an LFO and how it moves a DRAM read is unmeasured.

**Session 36e-f: input timing settled by tapping shipped read steps.** (FS1R.unlock `2026-10-02-084908-s25`,
`-085439-s25`.) Each segment holds L = r[0d] (0cf re-pointed) and R = one shipped DRAM read step tapped into d[11];
the replay fed the segment's own L must reproduce R. With r[0d] = tap[p + 1] / 0.7071 and r[0e] = tap[p + 2] / 0.7071
(the 0cf tap reads r[0d] a pass after it holds the value the program sees), every tapped read step (003, 013, 017,
01b, 0a3) matches the unit to 1 LSB over 9000 samples, so the DRAM line timing, slot offsets and write rules on the
input lines are right. The replay check (`tools/vop3_replay.py`) moves to Hall1 exact to 1927 samples.

**Session 36g-k: capture source is step distance, not slot; Hall1 / Hall9 click replays exact to rounding.**
(FS1R.unlock `2026-10-02-090236-s25`, `-092531-s25`, `-093836-s25`, `-103008-s25`.)

* Method: one shipped step at a time re-pointed into d[11] (R), with r[0d] on L, under the s36d click; the replay
  fed L must reproduce R. 30 of the first 32 taps (02a..088) and 0a3..0b5 exact over 12000 samples; the first
  divergences cluster on paths through d[38] (0d2 reads it) and d[27] (0d3), both fed by capture 0ce.
* **Rule (adopted):** a capture (daddr 0x100|n) at step st takes the latest DRAM transfer of this pass made 3..11
  steps earlier, else holds. s16's "slot s-2, else s-1" picked 0c5 (a class-0 read of slot 0x31, offset 0x10000)
  for 0ce; the unit takes 0c9's read. Discriminator: d[12] at 0be reads exact 0 on the unit (s36k) as the rule
  predicts; the alternative "slots parked at >= 0x10000 make no transfer" predicts a 7766 LSB peak there.
* Result: Hall1 click replay error rms 63 -> 0.6 LSB (40000 samples, max 5 LSB, corr 0.999996, +0.01 dB); Hall9
  114 -> 0.9 LSB (max 6, corr 0.999998). `tools/vop3_replay.py` asserts max error <= 8 LSB. Self-check 398/398.
* Board: 2 takes better (u3c, ud27), 3 worse: us098 / d77 by 1 LSB of rounding, d3c by 15 LSB late in a
  segment that follows u3c (u3c's 14 LSB miss moves to d3c: the same tail, now on the other side of a keep). OPEN.
* Noise replays (s35j / s36a) stay at corr 0.67..0.89: those takes start mid-stream with the unit's DRAM full of
  earlier noise, which the replay cannot know. The click takes start from silence and are the exactness test.
* Remaining at <= 6 LSB: rounding (output / accumulator LSB conventions), first at Hall1 1927 / Hall9 2236.

**Session 37: the effect input pair is per algorithm; every VOP3-2 type replayed from a click.** (FS1R.unlock
`2026-10-02-104635-s25`, `-140637-s25`.) Take: one config per algorithm, each with `_ia` / `_ib` re-pointing the
0cf tap at r[0d] / r[0e], `_ir` at the driven register, all under a fresh click per segment.

* `rev3c` Room1 / `rev8c` Plate: r[0d] drives the output (err rms 1.8 / 1.3 LSB, corr 1.00000 over 16000 samples).
* `rev13c` Delay LCR / `var20c` Delay LCR: **the mono send pair arrives on r[0d] and r[0e] only for the
  algorithm that reads it there; Delay LCR reads r[0e]** (a single register, driven by the second tap) — feeding
  r[0d] gives exact 0, r[0e] gives corr 1.0000 / 2 LSB. Variation types read r[0f] / r[10].
* The Delay algorithms are **not clean** in a multi-config take: their output equals their own segment's R for
  the first ~5100 samples and holds a constant after (the delay ring is 2^18 words at 48 kHz, so an earlier
  config's tail is still in it). Replaying them needs a silence lead-in and a single config per take; a rig round
  is queued. Under those terms `rev13c` is exact (corr 1.0000).
* Register-level rule: **which register the hardware drives depends on the algorithm**, and the base program's
  own writers (steps 0xda-0x0e7 for the delay mix, 0x13e/0x140 re-pointed at r[0d]/r[0e] for the delay programs)
  move the input on. The tap is the way to ask: re-point 0cf at each register in turn (s36). `_ia` / `_ib` /
  `_ir` on a per-algorithm config is the shape of every future replay round.

**Session 37c: the mono send feeds both registers of the pair; the delay algorithms are exact.** (FS1R.unlock
`2026-10-02-142901-s25`.) Each delay config captured alone, after a silence segment, with the taps re-pointed per
register: `rev13e` Delay LCR and `var20e` Delay LCR both reproduce the unit to 2.3-2.8 LSB (corr 0.99999, gain
0.9999, lag 0) over 14000 samples, when r[0d]/r[0e] and r[0f]/r[10] are fed the same recorded send — feeding only
the second register of the pair is enough (the two registers carry the same send; s36's "r[0e] two passes later"
is step 003's in-place scale, not a different signal). The earlier zero-output and constant-hold readings were
the take's own delay ring: a Delay config captured after other configs still holds their tail (2^18 words at
48 kHz), so delay algorithms need a single config per take with a silence lead — both now measured.
* `rev7e` (reverb 7 Stage2, the base program) still misses: model rms 99/165 against the unit's 236/238, corr
  0.83/0.94 at gains 2.0/1.35 (OPEN — the stage program's own input path differs from Hall1/Plate's).

**Session 37d: VOP3-1's program structure, as far as it goes without the rig.** (`docs/vop3/program_0.bin`, 512
steps; class 2 = 416, class 1 = 57, class 0 = 7, class 3 = 32.)

* It is a repetition of one 20-step filter block writing its own register bank: **block A at 0x059 writes
  r[02..0x18]**, **block B at 0x14d writes r[0x31..0x48]**, **block C at 0x1c9 writes r[0x49..0x60]**, and the
  upper half (0x100 up) repeats the pattern for the channel's own copy. Blocks are not translations of each
  other, so register numbers carry the block's identity, not its position.
* Each block opens with an 8-step header (e.g. 0x059-0x060) that writes the **parameter file r[0x65], r[0x66],
  r[0x68], r[0x69], r[0x6b], r[0x6c]** with class-2 op-0 steps (rA = the destination, one running value passed
  step to step), then runs the two biquad sections.
* **r[0x64], r[0x67], r[0x6a] are read as `f6c` operands - the filter coefficients - and never written by any
  step.** The candidate voice-audio registers are the block heads r[07]/[08]/[09], r[13]/[14]/[15],
  r[31..35], r[49..4d], each read by op 0 / op 3 / op 5 steps and never written. No step is an op-1 route-0
  step, so the DAC path is not how the filtered voice leaves; the output stages 0f0 / 0f8 are the candidates.
* This is where the rig takes over: re-point a probe step into d[10] as in s36 and drive r[07], r[13], r[31],
  r[49] in turn. `Vop3Filter` now carries the map, the `param()` write (FUN_0000B5E2) and the OPEN list.

**Session 38a: driving VOP3-1 registers from the monitor under a running note is silent.** (FS1R.unlock
`2026-10-02-145907-s25`; `docs/vop3_ship/38a.probes.json`.) A filter part with the operator silent (`level=0`,
so the note itself contributes nothing) and the 8 candidate registers r[07]/[13]/[31]/[49]/[64]/[67]/[6a]/[0d]
held at +-0x4000 for 0.35 s each through the firmware's own write (FUN_0000B5E2, the s25 runner's new `regs`
field): every segment reads the same -56.6 dBFS floor as the reference, +-0.1 dB (0.5 s, 48 kHz). So
* the write does not take effect under a running note (the firmware stages VOP3-1 through register 0 and 11,
  and a direct poke may need the chip idle), or
* none of these registers is the sounding channel's input.
The next step is the same sweep on a **silent** chip (no note: the register writes are then unambiguously the
only signal, and a write that appears at the output proves the write path), then the register probe under a note
once the path is proven.

**Session 38b: a silent filter part makes no sound at all, so the register write path is still unproven.**
(FS1R.unlock `2026-10-02-150543-s25`; `docs/vop3_ship/38b.probes.json`.) 13 registers written with 0x4000 and
back to 0 on a silent chip (voice off): every segment is exact digital silence (L and R max 0.0). A filter part
whose operator is silent produces nothing even with the program running, so this cannot separate "the write
does not land" from "the program passes nothing"; s38c (audible note, coefficient cells r[64]/[67]/[6a] and the
lane heads swept) is the deciding round.

**Session 38c: writing the filter's coefficient cells does not change the response.** (FS1R.unlock
`2026-10-02-151144-s25`; `docs/vop3_ship/38c.probes.json`.) An audible filter part, 28 segments: r[0x64],
r[0x67], r[0x6a] (the cells the program reads as `f6c` coefficient operands) and the lane heads r[07]/[13]/
[31]/[49] each written 0x0000/0x4000/0x8000/0xC000. Every segment reads within +-1 dB of the reference level
(-64.4 dBFS) and within a few dB per band (noise). So the monitor's direct register write either does not
reach the chip while it is running the voice, or those registers are not in the sounding channel's path.
*The harness point first:* the filter part as configured here only produces -64 dBFS, which is too little
headroom for a register-difference test; the next round raises the source (operator level, filter gain, or
the cutoff) until the reference reads near -20 dBFS, then repeats this sweep. `regs` / `filter` in the s25
runner are the interface (FS1R.unlock, `fs1r_capture_session25.py`).

**Session 38d: the monitor's VOP3-1 register write does not reach the running chip.** (FS1R.unlock
`2026-10-02-152257-s25`; `docs/vop3_ship/38d.probes.json`.) The s38c sweep with the source at full (operator
level 127, cutoff 64, note 36), so the reference reads -34.9 dBFS: all 28 segments land within +-0.1 dB of the
reference overall and every band difference is noise (the largest, 6.4 dB in the 20-40 Hz band, also appears at
repeat writes of the same value). Writing r[0x64], r[0x67], r[0x6a] - read by the program as `f6c` coefficient
operands, so they must change the filter if they land - and the lane heads r[07]/[13]/[31]/[49] leaves the
response untouched.

**Conclusion: FUN_0000B5E2 does not reach the running chip's register file from the monitor.** That is why
every VOP3-1 probe so far reads as nothing, and it is the blocker for the whole VOP3-1 input-register question
(and for the s8 `bits` runs, which write program steps, not registers - those do land, so the *program* path is
live and the *register* path is not). Candidates: the write needs the chip idle / a status handshake
(`DAT_010683E0` is VOP3-2's busy; VOP3-1's may be elsewhere), or the routine's register 0/11 staging (the
`FUN_0000B6A4` pair) is what the chip actually samples.

**Session 38e: VOP3-1's coefficient port is registers 0 and 11, and the audio path is still OPEN.**
(`FUN_0000B6A4` decompile + `docs/vop3/program_0.bin`.) The firmware's own coefficient write is a *pair*:
register 0 takes the coefficient **slot** number and register 11 takes the **value** (`FUN_0000C36C` stages
`0x01068F78[slot]` then calls `FUN_0000B6A4(1, ptr)`), which is why the boot program opens with steps 000-008
reading r[0]. A monitor poke of a *coefficient slot* through `FUN_0000B5E2` therefore writes the slot number
where the value belongs - which is exactly the historical "the panel lit up" failure. So r[0]/r[11] are the
coefficient port, not audio, and every s38 register sweep that wrote r[0]/[11] was writing the wrong thing.
Still OPEN: which register carries the voice audio. `docs/vop3/program_0.bin` never reads r[0]/r[11] as operands,
so the audio must sit in a cell the program reads and never writes; `tools/vop3_core_check.py` now asserts that
`Vop3Filter` loads and runs the measured program, so the next rig round starts from a wired module.

**Session 38f: VOP3-1's head is a table setup; the filter's parameter cells are the f6c 0x11/0x14/0x17/0x1a.**
(`docs/vop3/program_0.bin` 0x000-0x01f.) Steps 000-00e write d[] cells (0x18, 0x59, 0xd7, 0x1bf/0x1be/0x1bd,
0x83) and load r[01..05] - the table the firmware patches at note-on (FUN_0000D050 changes a channel's type
and gains in the live shadow, not the image). From 0x010 on, the filter proper: class-2 op 5 reading
`f6c` 0x11 / 0x14 / 0x17 / 0x1a (the per-voice parameter cells) storing into d[] 0x01/0x02/0x03/0x04, then
class-1 loads r[61]/r[62]/r[63] and the two biquad sections (0x1c+). So the parameter cells a rig probe can
sweep with visible effect are `f6c` 0x11/0x14/0x17/0x1a, with r[61]/[62]/[63] the cutoff/resonance/gain
constants - a much smaller candidate set than the 128-register sweep. Still OPEN: the audio input register,
which no step writes and (per s38d) the monitor cannot reach while the chip runs.

**Session 38g: VOP3-1's output is the SUM BUS, and 33 registers feed it (four lane groups).**
(`docs/vop3/program_0.bin`.) The boot program has **no d[10]/d[11] write at all** (the s38 DAC sweep found zero
registers reaching the DAC cells), but it does have **48 class-2 op-1 route-0 steps**, which is the model's sum
bus. Driving each of the 128 registers and reading that bus instead:

    0x09 0x0a 0x0b   0x15 0x16 0x17   0x1b 0x1c 0x1d    (the first lane, x4 offsets)
    0x21 0x22 0x23   0x2d 0x2e 0x2f   0x33 0x34 0x35
    0x39 0x3a 0x3b   0x45 0x46 0x47   0x4b 0x4c 0x4d
    0x51 0x52 0x53   0x5d 0x5e 0x5f
    (+ lane groups at +0x18 and +0x30): 33 registers in **four lanes of a three-register group plus the
    filter-state cells**. Each lane is one filter channel's input/output trio, so the voice's audio enters
    through a lane register and the filtered result leaves through a later one in the same lane.

That is the candidate set the rig needs, and it is small: the next round drives lane 0's r[09]/r[0a]/r[0b] (and
the +0x18/+0x30 equivalents) with the loud filter part already in hand. Note the ordering rule: **on VOP3-1 the
output is the sum bus, not the DAC cells** - the model's `bus` (op-1 route 0) is the right output there.

**Session 38i: the VOP3-1 register window is gated by register 1, and the channel map is known.**
(`FUN_0000BC8C` / `FUN_0000B600` decompiles, `FILT_STEPS` 0x374E44 / `BLOCK_TAB` 0x374F2E.)

* **The window bit.** `FUN_0000B5E2(1, 0x1004)` **opens** VOP3-1's register window and `FUN_0000B5E2(1, 0)`
  closes it; `FUN_0000BC8C` brackets its whole upload that way, and `FUN_0000B600` writes a step as
  `FUN_0000B5E2(0, slot)` then `FUN_0000B5E2(10 - k, word)` (k = 0..4). All of s38a-38h wrote registers with the
  window **closed**, which is why 128 registers and 33 lane cells all read as nothing. Every future VOP3-1
  probe must open the window first (FS1R.unlock `fs1r_capture_session25.py` now does it around `regs`).
* **The channel map** (what the note lands on, so a probe writes the right lane):
  ch0 0x70, ch1-3 0x90, ch4-5 0xf0, ch6-7 0x110, ch8-11 0x170, ch12-15 0x10 - the group whose cutoff step the
  table names. A channel's lane trio is at the group's own cells, so a probe reads `FILT_STEPS[channel]` and
  `BLOCK_TAB[channel]` and writes that group.
